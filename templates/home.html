			<p>The topic of Greek migration broke into the German discourse in the last five years, with the economic crisis. The main narrative around the Greek migration to Germany was then bound to the desperate state of the Greek economy. But what happened to the idea of “Europe”? What’s left of the freedom of movement granted by the European values and principles? Some are still there. Others have moved backed to their homeland. Diving into the life stories of the Greeks who came to Germany brings a series of complexities to surface. All of them had the experience of taking a “Taxi to Berlin”</p>

			<p>Katerina Michailidi was born in Athens in 1986. Her first contact with Germany took place in March 2008, when she moved to Berlin as an Erasmus student. She studied theatre at the National Kapodistrian University of Athens and spent one semester studying at the Freie Universität. « The first day was a nightmare » – Katerina says, when she recalls her arrival in Berlin – « But it turned out to be one of the best experiences in my life. » The Erasmus triggered a series of unexpected consequences. She just came for six months, and ended up staying for more than six years.</p>

			<div class="legend">It was my choice…</div>

			<p>Katerina was one of the Greek students who chose Germany as a destination country for their semesters abroad. During the last six academic years more than 2.500 Erasmus students from Greece joined a German university.</p>

			<p>When the crisis struck her home country in late 2008, Katerina was living in Berlin and followed the alarming situation in Greece from the news. « I was planning to go back to Athens, but the crisis made me realise that I shouldn’t. » That was also what friends and family kept telling her. The disturbing events in Greece made her feel as a powerless observer as the crisis unfold. « It felt like a bomb exploded », Katerina explains.</p>

			</div>

			<p>After graduating, Katerina went back to Berlin and started multiple activities. She began working for Sourcefabric, an open-source software organisation, freelancing for Transmediale festival and managing various events. She co-founded Mixing Roots Productions, an organization that brought Greek musicians to the German capital. She joined SUPERMARKT – a creative co-working and event space in Berlin – working as an events & communications manager. </p>

			<p>Katerina’s immigrant background was never a problem in her everyday life, except some rare episodes of casual discrimination. She experienced the working atmosphere as one of mutual respect with her German colleagues. Katerina continues to live and work in Berlin. «I’m happy to belong to both countries», she says.</p>

			<p>Ares Kalandides was born in Athens in 1964. He came to Berlin in 1989. « Two days after the wall came down ». Ares spent half of his life in Greece, the other half in Germany. For years, he had a normal life here: friends, job, family. A new routine. But the economic crisis changed his views on the country that was hosting him. As a Greek citizen, he found himself suddenly confronted with a racist escalation of the public discourse. </p>

			<p>Ares moved to Berlin at a time when the city was undergoing complete transformation. His life took some interesting turns. Holding a degree in French literature and being fluent in several other languages, Ares began working in the field of urban planning. He started in:polis, an urban development company which now employs 14 people, most of whom are German. Ares consulted on dozens of projects of urban development throughout Germany and Europe and has published research articles and books. He was one of those whom the statistic institutes define as «high-skilled migrants».  </p>

			<p>In 2008 the crisis hit Europe and the youth unemployment rates in southern-europe skyrocketed. Year after year, the percentage of young Greeks without a job kept on rising. In 2013, for example, 58.3% young Greeks were counted by Eurostat as unemployed.</p>

			<p>As a response to the crisis, many young Greeks decided to move out of their country. Germany was one of the top destionation. But these immigration flows triggered a series of populistic reactions among the German elites and the public opinion. </p>

			<p>The perception of a Greek invasion became part of the German collective imaginary. However, official data from Eurostat – the European Institute of Statistics – debunk the myth. The size of the Greek community in Germany kept roughly stable over the last 6 years.</p>

			<p>Twenty-five years ago he fled Athens to « escape » the atmosphere reigning in Greece in the late eighties. He found an open-minded society in Berlin where he could start a new life and became a german citizen in 2000. But Ares reacted sharply to the rise of xenophobic rethoric in Germany. The air became unbreathable. He ceased perceiving himself as a German-Greek. « If I could, I would give back my german nationality, but it is impossible.» </p>
